\title{SE_subset: Subset SummarizedExperiment Object by Features or Samples}
\usage{
SE_subset(SE, features = NULL, samples = NULL, condition = NULL, 
  exclude_features = NULL, exclude_samples = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{SE}{A \code{SummarizedExperiment} object containing gene expression data.}

\item{features}{A character vector of feature names to keep. If NULL, all features are kept. Default is NULL.}

\item{samples}{A character vector of sample names to keep. If NULL, all samples are kept. Default is NULL.}

\item{condition}{A named list or vector for conditional subsetting. Names should be column names in colData, and values should be the values to keep. Default is NULL.}

\item{exclude_features}{A character vector of feature names to exclude. Default is NULL.}

\item{exclude_samples}{A character vector of sample names to exclude. Default is NULL.}
}
\value{
A subsetted \code{SummarizedExperiment} object containing only the specified features and samples.
}
\description{
This function subsets a SummarizedExperiment object based on feature names, sample names, or conditions from colData. It provides flexible subsetting options to extract specific subsets of data for downstream analysis.
}
\examples{
# Load example SummarizedExperiment object
SE <- loadSE()

# Subset by specific features
SE_subset <- SE_subset(SE, features = c("Gene1", "Gene2", "Gene3"))

# Subset by specific samples
SE_subset <- SE_subset(SE, samples = c("Sample1", "Sample2"))

# Subset by condition from colData
SE_subset <- SE_subset(SE, condition = list(group = "Treatment"))

# Subset by multiple conditions
SE_subset <- SE_subset(SE, condition = list(group = c("Treatment1", "Treatment2"), batch = 1))

# Exclude specific features
SE_subset <- SE_subset(SE, exclude_features = c("GeneX", "GeneY"))

# Combine features and condition subsetting
SE_subset <- SE_subset(SE, features = c("Gene1", "Gene2"), condition = list(group = "Treatment"))
}
