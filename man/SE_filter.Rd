\title{SE_filter: Filter Features in SummarizedExperiment Object}
\usage{
SE_filter(SE, assayname = "TPM", min_expr = 0, min_detectratio = 0, 
  min_variance = 0, min_cv = 0, group_colname = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{SE}{A \code{SummarizedExperiment} object containing gene expression data.}

\item{assayname}{A string indicating which assay to use for filtering. The default value is \code{"TPM"}.}

\item{min_expr}{Numeric value. Minimum expression threshold. Features with mean expression below this value will be removed. Default is 0.}

\item{min_detectratio}{Numeric value between 0 and 1. Minimum detection ratio threshold. Features with detection ratio below this value will be removed. Default is 0.}

\item{min_variance}{Numeric value. Minimum variance threshold. Features with variance below this value will be removed. Default is 0.}

\item{min_cv}{Numeric value. Minimum coefficient of variation (CV) threshold. Features with CV below this value will be removed. Default is 0.}

\item{group_colname}{A string representing the column name in \code{colData} that contains group information. This is optional; if provided, filtering will be performed within each group separately.}
}
\value{
A filtered \code{SummarizedExperiment} object with features that pass all specified filtering criteria.
}
\description{
This function filters features (genes/proteins) in a SummarizedExperiment object based on various criteria including expression level, detection ratio, variance, and coefficient of variation. It provides flexible filtering options to remove low-quality features before downstream analysis.
}
\examples{
# Load example SummarizedExperiment object
SE <- loadSE()

# Filter features with minimum expression of 1 and minimum detection ratio of 0.5
SE_filtered <- SE_filter(SE, assayname = "TPM", min_expr = 1, min_detectratio = 0.5)

# Filter features with minimum CV of 0.1
SE_filtered <- SE_filter(SE, assayname = "TPM", min_cv = 0.1)

# Filter features within each group
SE_filtered <- SE_filter(SE, assayname = "TPM", min_expr = 1, group_colname = "group")
}
