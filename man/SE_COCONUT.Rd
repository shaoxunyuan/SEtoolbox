\title{Apply COCONUT to SummarizedExperiment List  
 
This function applies the COCONUT (COmbat CO-Normalization Using conTrols)   
algorithm to a list of SummarizedExperiment objects to remove batch effects  
while preserving biological signals.}
\usage{
SE_COCONUT(SElist, assayname = NULL, group_col = "group", label_healthy = "HC")
}
\arguments{
\item{SElist}{A list of SummarizedExperiment objects to be batch-corrected.}

\item{assayname}{Character string specifying which assay in the SummarizedExperiment
objects to use for batch correction. This must be an existing assay in all   
SummarizedExperiment objects.}

\item{group_col}{Character string specifying the column name in colData that
contains group information (e.g., disease status).}

\item{label_healthy}{Character string specifying the value in the group_col
that represents healthy controls (e.g., "HC").}
}
\value{
A list of SummarizedExperiment objects with batch-corrected data.
}
\description{
Apply COCONUT to SummarizedExperiment List  
 
This function applies the COCONUT (COmbat CO-Normalization Using conTrols)   
algorithm to a list of SummarizedExperiment objects to remove batch effects  
while preserving biological signals.
}
\details{
The function uses COCONUT to perform batch correction on expression   
  data from multiple sources. It requires a column in colData to distinguish   
  between disease and healthy samples. The algorithm uses healthy controls to   
  learn batch effects and applies the correction to all samples.  
  
  Note that the expression matrices must not contain zeros, as this can cause  
  numerical issues in the COCONUT algorithm. Please impute zeros before using  
  this function.
